# Description

This namespace defines "documentation writers".

"Documentation writers" perform the following actions:

  * Extract information from all the API's entry points (SQL requests and procedures).
  * Organize the information previously extracted (into an SQLite database).

Please note that there is one "documentation writer" for each brand (MySql, Oracle...) of database.
